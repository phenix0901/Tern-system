const FAQs: { question: string, answer: string }[] = [
    {
        question: "What is TernKey?",
        answer: "TernKey is a sandbox application built for software developers to experiment and learn how to code using programming languages that allow users to exploit ternary logic computing principles."
    },
    {
        question: "How much does it cost to use TernKey?",
        answer: "TernKey is free for the Basic plan and includes the TernKey Emulator. The TernKey Pro plan costs $20 per month and allows users to access history, profile settings, and the ability to save and explore Keys."
    },
    {
        question: "What does ternary mean?",
        answer: "Ternary is defined as using the number three as a base in mathematics. Binary uses base two and is represented using the characters `0` and `1`, representing the decimal values `0` and `+1`, respectively. Ternary, on the other hand, uses three representative characters. Specifically, our technology uses balanced ternary, `-`, `0`, and `+`, representing the decimal values `-1`, `0`, and `+1`, respectively."
    },
    {
        question: "Why is it called TernKey?",
        answer: "TernKey is a play on words. By using the prefix of the word ternary—' Tern`—and attaching `Key` at the end, we both illustrate the technology's differentiation and ease of use. TernKey is a turn-key technology that is ready to immediately implement and showcases how ternary logic programming will shift the paradigm of the computer industry."
    },
    {
        question: "What is a Key?",
        answer: "A Key is a program written by a TernKey user. Pro users can save their Keys and share them with the world as an ExploreKey or decide to keep them private as one of your MyKeys."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I see the history of my programs?",
        answer: "Yes, the sidebar contains a history section dedicated to keeping your past programs and drafts contained in an easy-to-navigate container separated by the current session, the entire day, the day prior, and the week prior."
    },
    {
        question: "How can I save a Key I've created?",
        answer: "A Key can be saved by clicking the SaveKey button located in the bottom right-hand corner of the TernKey Emulator screen. Once clicked, a popup will occupy the screen with two input fields and one toggle button for the user, the name of the Key, a short description, and a button allowing the user to create the Key privately or to publish the Key to the ExploreKey Store.",
    },
    {
        question: "How can I save a Key I've created?",
        answer: "A Key can be saved by clicking the SaveKey button located in the bottom right-hand corner of the TernKey Emulator screen. Once clicked, a popup will occupy the screen with two input fields and one toggle button for the user, the name of the Key, a short description, and a button allowing the user to create the Key privately or to publish the Key to the ExploreKey Store."
    },
    {
        question: "How do I resolve a billing issue?",
        answer: "You can resolve billing issues by contacting our resolution center at billing@tern.ac or +1 (914) 306-5528."
    },
    {
        question: "Why don't I have a sidebar?",
        answer: "If you do not see a sidebar on your TernKey application, you may need to create an account and login. If you are logged into your TernKey account and still do not see a sidebar, you must purchase the Pro Plan to access this feature."
    },
    {
        question: "Do I need to login to use TernKey?",
        answer: "No."
    },
    {
        question: "What does BTMC mean?",
        answer: "BTMC is an acronym that stands for Balanced Ternary Machine Code. Balanced ternary differs from conventional ternary in that the character representations of the decimal values `-1`, `0`, and `+1` are `-`, `0`, and `+`, respectively, instead of other, less -efficient, alternatives."
    },
    {
        question: "What does TERN mean?",
        answer: "TERN is an acronym that stands for Ternary Executable Ratiocinative Nexus. In essence, this name communicates the central point of the exact thinking process of our balanced ternary programming languages: TERN, the assembly programming language for G, the high-level programming language atop the stack of TernKey languages."
