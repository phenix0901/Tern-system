                TernKey Pro Plan Subscription Limitations
            </h2>
            <div>
                <span>
                    As part of the TernKey Pro plan, specific usage limitations are implemented to maintain optimal
                    service quality and safeguard system performance across the platform. These limitations are
                    designed to prevent potential traffic overloads and ensure the consistent functioning of the
                    application for all users. The following constraints apply:
                </span>
            </div>
            <ul className={'flex flex-col list-disc my-[1.15rem] pl-[1.5rem] gap-[0.84rem]'}>
                <li>
                    <span className={'font-bold'}>Daily Server Space Allocation:</span> Each Pro plan user is
                    allocated a defined amount of server
                    space on a daily basis. This allocation, while generous, is designed to manage overall
                    system load effectively and prevent any one user from monopolizing resources. The limits
                    ensure stable performance and equitable access to server resources for all users.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span className={'font-bold'}>Application Performance:</span> To ensure continued system
                    efficiency, safeguards are in place that
                    may impact performance if certain thresholds are exceeded. Specifically, if a user exceeds
                    100 Key compositions within a 24-hour period, the application may experience reduced speed
                    or performance. This mechanism is an intentional measure to maintain the integrity of the
                    platform and ensure its smooth operation for all users.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span className={'font-bold'}>Abuse and Misuse:</span> Any attempts to circumvent or exploit
                    these limitations, such as through excessive server space usage or resource-intensive
                    activities, may result in temporary or permanent access restrictions or a slowdown in
                    service. These measures are enforced to preserve the platform&apos;s overall stability,
                    reliability and security.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div>
                <span>
                    These limitations are essential to protect the TernKey platform’s operational integrity and
                    ensure a high-quality experience for all users. Adherence to these guidelines allows for the
                    continued delivery of a consistent, reliable, and performant service.
